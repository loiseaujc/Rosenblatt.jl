# Rosenblatt.jl

**Warning:** This package is currently under active development and is by no means targeting real life applications. It is primarily used for teaching purposes.

This package contains lightweight implementations in pure Julia of a variety of linear learning machines based on the original [Perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron) introduced by [F. Rosenblatt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Rosenblatt) as early as 1957.
As of September 2022, it includes the following models:
- the original [Perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron) model for binary classification problems,
- the dual formulation of the original Perceptron as an example to introduce kernel methods,
- the Multiclass Perceptron for multiclass problems.

## Examples

Below is a list of example applications using a simple perceptron-based classifier.

## Developments goals

Developing this package is primarily used as an excuse for me to get familiar with Julia and test some ideas.
I also intend to use it for my introductory class to Machine Learning.
If you are interested in using it or helping in its development, please do not hesitate to get in touch!
